# Checkpoint Commits

Before taking any action, you must make sure that it can be reverted easily and cleanly. First, check if there is a checkpointing feature enabled. If not, check if there is any uncommitted work in the repository and if there is, create a new checkpoint commit that includes all current changes. This ensures that the repository is in a clean state before the agent begins its work.
