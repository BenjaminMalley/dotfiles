# Global Agent Directives

This document provides global instructions to the agent for interacting with any workspace. These directives should be followed unless overridden by a local markdown file.

## General

- **Be proactive:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly, including reasonable, directly implied follow-up actions.
- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.
